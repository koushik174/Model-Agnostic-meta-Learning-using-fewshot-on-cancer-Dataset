## Introduction

### Background
This project implements Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) for few-shot learning on chest X-ray images for cancer detection. The implementation utilizes a DenseNet backbone architecture followed by MAML adaptation to improve few-shot learning capabilities in medical image classification.

### Motivation
- Medical image datasets often have limited labeled data
- Need for quick adaptation to new classes with few examples
- Importance of robust cancer detection systems
- Application of meta-learning in healthcare

### Key Features
- DenseNet121 backbone for robust feature extraction
- MAML implementation for few-shot learning
- Custom dataset handling for medical images
- Memory-efficient GPU implementation
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics
- Visualization tools for results analysis
